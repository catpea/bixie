## What Is Bixie?

bixie /bik'see/ n.
Alternative emoticons used on BIX (the BIX Information eXchange).
The most common (smiley) bixie is &lt;@_@&gt;, representing two
cartoon eyes and a mouth. These were originally invented in an SF
fanzine called APA-L and imported to BIX by one of the earliest users.
